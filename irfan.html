		<h2>About Me</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Hello! My name is Irfan Bashir. I am a sophomore and an international student from Indian administered part of Kashmir pursuing a BA in Financial Economics at the University of Rochester, New York.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I am currently working in many roles. I am the co-founder of the Federation for Peace and Development (FPD), which my partners and I founded in December 2016. Although it is in Srinagar, Kashmir, I am still responsible for management, recruitment, planning, and outreach. I am also a Digital Media Specialist at Rettner. My responsibilities include troubleshooting errors, 3d printing, call logging, maintenance of systems, and large scale printing. On the job, I have learned how to use many software programs, such as Autodesk 3ds and Blender. I am also a special correspondent, reporter, and editor with The Kashmir Scan since June 2009. My responsibilities include interviewing various notable statespeople, political journalism, travel journalism, photography, and marketing. I've also worked as a content manager in the past with Sareeh. I managed content uploaded to the website and handled graphic design handle book uploads.</p>

			<h3>Course Work</h3>
				<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a Financial Economics major. As a result, I have a lot of economics and finance courses under my belt. I am taking Finance, Economics, Computer Science and Dance courses this semester. Dance is by far my most favorite as it helps me become more aware of my body and experiment with flow and movement. My economics course taught by Professor Rizzo is interesting in that it doesn’t fit the general description of an economics course. Professor Rizzo believes in applying meta-principles in everyday life to help us better evaluate cost/benefit decisions. All in all, my course load this semester is both exciting and challenging and covers both mental and physical aspects of human learning. Spring of 18 feels good, so far!</p>

			<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
				<p>My hobbies are as basic as it gets. I like to read books (both fiction and non fiction), mostly books that deal with metaphysics, psychology, love, science, poetry and human nature, although I am not a picky reader and will read anything. Consequently, I like to write too. I mostly write short stories, news articles and poetry. I still don’t think I can write in English as well as I can write in Urdu. I like to read books that are written in English, but my language preference for poetry is Urdu. I think English is very well suited for prose but not poetry. I like to listen to Sufi music in my spare time. One practice I have is: I try to identify layers of music in a song and then figure out the beat. I would like to learn an instrument- maybe flute or violin.</p>

			<h3>Hometown Info</h3>
				<p>I was born in Srinagar, in the Indian administered part of Jammu and Kashmir state. It is located in Srinagar District, which is in the northwestern part of Jammu and Kashmir state, close to the Pakistani-Indian border. The population was 1,273,312, according to the 2011 Census. The city is estimated to have been founded in the 6th Century AD. The city is governed by Srinagar Municipal Corporation, which is essentially an elected body of councillors. The council's leader is Ghulam Mustafa Bhat.</p>

			<h3>Initial Role</h3>
				<p>My initial role was to be a design artist. I have always been interested in designing be it Front End Web design or graphical design. I do plan to switch roles as the semester progresses, but Designer will be my priority role, followed by maybe Information Architecture. My on-campus job as a 'Digital Media Specialist' also puts me at advantage when it comes to design. I have working experience with Adobe Photoshop CC, Corel draw and InDesign. When I think of design, I try to bring abstraction into my work which allows the meaning of what I create to be open to interpretation. My goal as a designer for this class would be show some element of abstraction in my work.</p>
