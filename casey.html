		<h2>About Me</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Hello! My name is Casey Adam Brentnall. I am a sophomore, and my major is computer science. I was born on January 12, 1998, and my hometown is Rochester, NY.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>Currently, I work as a Standardized Patient in a Suicide Prevention Training program at URMC. In this program, I've developed a character who is at risk for suicide, and I work with physicians and psychologists, helping them learn how to identify and treat depression and suicide. In the past, I've worked as a cashier at BJ's Wholesale Club, and Family Dollar. At these jobs, I both ran a cash register and stocked, cleaned, and handled returns. I've also worked summers as an ice cream scooper and cook at Friendly's. I learned how to make a variety of simple food items, and was in charge of cleaning the grill area thoroughly at the end of every shift.</p>

			<h3>Course Work</h3>
				<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a double major in Computer Science and English. Because of this, my previous coursework is a pretty even mix of CSC and ENG courses. I've taken classes in acting, directing, dialect training, and in theatrical performance. On the computer science side, I've taken Data Structures and Algorithms, Formal Computation and Systems, and all the required math courses. This semester, I'm taking Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, my next step in the computer science track. I'm also taking Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, my first math class after calculus. I'm taking this class, and lastly I'm taking Musical Theatre Workshop, a course in preparing scenework and audition materials for musical theatre actors.</p>

			<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
				<p>In my free time, I like to sing, play guitar, and see as many movies as I can. On campus, I'm involved in TOOP, a student run theatrical group, and ROC Players, a musical theatre organization. In the past, I've appeared in plays in the Todd International Theatre Program. This semester, I'll be appearing onstage in ROC Player's production of Spring Awakening as Moritz Steifel.</p>

			<h3>Hometown Info</h3>
				<p>I was born in Farmington, New York. Farmington is a town located in the northern part of Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 11,825 at the 2010 census. Farmington is about twenty-five miles southeast of Rochester, New York. The town was formed along with its county in 1789. The town is governed by a town council, and the council's supervisor is Peter Ingalsbe.</p>

			<h3>Initial Role</h3>
				<p>My initial role was to be a design artist. I would be responsible for everything the user sees, in any browser type and size. I make decisions about the graphic design, specifically relating to the colors, the styles, the fonts, and the layouts of the website. I would ensure these components would work across any browser type and size. For me, good graphic design shouldn't cause readability problems. The presentation layer (styles) would be coded in CSS so it is visually arranged in a way that makes sense for the content and adds value to the structure layer. Styles (CSS) should meet industry standards and best practices including W3C CSS validation within reason.</p>
